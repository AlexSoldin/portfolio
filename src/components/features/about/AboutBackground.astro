          I am a software engineer who loves building <span class="font-normal"
            >systems that work</span

          operations that help companies scale smoothly. However, I am up for any challenge that comes
          my way.

          I believe the best engineering balances technical excellence with practical impact and I'm
          drawn to work that sits at the intersection of code, product and business.

          in environments where I can build end-to-end solutions, collaborate across teams and solve
          problems that matter.

            I started coding while at school in Johannesburg. Choosing information technology, and
            later electrical and computer engineering at university, were educated guesses that
            turned out to be the right ones. I've always enjoyed maths and puzzles, especially
            problems where patterns emerge and logic leads to elegant solutions. Engineering gave me
            a way to apply that way of thinking to real-world problems.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-lg text-(--foreground)/80">
            What drew me to software was the immediacy of building something useful. Seeing an idea
            turn into a working system is deeply satisfying, and that feeling only grows at scale.
            Automating repetitive work or designing systems that simply work saves real time and
            creates genuine value. The most rewarding part is turning frustration into solutions
            that feel clear, reliable, and easy to use.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-lg text-(--foreground)/80">
            Engineering isn't just about technology. Meaningful progress happens when people feel
            supported through change. I focus on empathy and clear communication, especially when
            working across disciplines or bridging technical and non-technical teams. By listening
            closely and understanding what teams actually need, I aim to design solutions that fit
            naturally into how they work. Trust, collaboration, and shared understanding are as
            critical to good systems as the code itself.
          </p>
          <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg text-(--foreground)/80">
            Being observant has become central to how I work. I pay close attention to how systems
            behave, where processes break down, and where small details create unnecessary friction.
            Over time, I've learned that consistent structure and care for those details are what
            separate systems that function from systems that last.
